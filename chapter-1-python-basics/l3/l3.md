## Booleans
---

A boolean is a type that only has 2 possibile values. Most often, you will hear these values as true or false, but they are also often refered to as 1 or 0. Boolean values are very helpful in controlling the flow of a program. They allow us to do certain actions based on the current state of the program.

In Python, the simplest way to set a boolean is to use the `True` and `False` keywords. See an example below.

```Python
# You can use the 'True' and 'False' keywords to set boolean values
first_example_boolean = True
second_example_boolean = False
```

Notice how both keywords are *capitalized*. If you forget to capitalize the keyword, Python will think you are referencing an undefined variable, and will cause an error.

## Operators
---

Operators in Python are symbols that we can use to manipulate values. You have already learned about the **assignment operator** (`=`). The assignment operator sets a variable to the specified value. Most operators in Python are easy to understand. Below you can find some tables of many common operators in Python.

### Arithmetic Operators
---

Operator Name     | Description                                                  | Python Symbol
------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------
Addition          | Add the value on the left with the value on the right        | `+`
Subtraction       | Subtract the value on the right from the value on the left   | `-`
Multiplication    | Multiply the value on the left with the value on the right   | `*`
Division          | Divide the value on the right from the value on the left     | `/`
Integer division  | Divide, then floor the result                                | `//`
Modulo            | The remainder of the left divided by the right               | `%`
Exponent          | The value to the left raised to the power of the right value | `**`

### Assignment Operators
---

Symbol | Example  | Expanded Equivalent  | Description
-------|----------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------
`=`    | `x = y`  | `x = y`              | Set x to the value of y
`+=`   | `x += y` | `x = x + y`          | Add y to x, then set x to the result
`-=`   | `x -= y` | `x = x - y`          | Subtract y from x, then set x to the result
`*=`   | `x *= y` | `x = x * y`          | Multiply x by y, then set x to the result
`/=`   | `x /= y` | `x = x / y`          | Divide y from x then set x to the result
`%=`   | `x %= y` | `x = x % y`          | Set x to the result of x modulus y
`//=`  | `x //= y`| `x = x // y`         | Set x to the integer division of x by y
`**=`  | `x **= y`| `x = x ** y`         | Set x to x raised to the y power

### Comparison Operators
---

Name                     | Symbol   | Example  
-------------------------|----------|----------
Equal                    | `==`     | `x == 10`
Not equal                | `!=`     | `x != 5` 
Less than                | `<`      | `x < 7`   
Greater than             | `>`      | `x > 3`   
Less than or equal to    | `<=`     | `x <= 2`
Greater than or equal to | `>=`     | `x >= 8`

### Logical Operators
---

Name    | Symbol    | Example     | Description
--------|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------------------
Not     | `not`     | `not x`     | The opposite of the value on the right
Or      | `or`      | `x or y`    | True if at least one of the values is true
And     | `and`     | `x and y`   | Only true if *both* x and y are true

That's a lot of operators! But don't worry, you don't have to remember every operator! And believe it or not, there are still some operators that aren't included in those tables! Let's go over some examples using operators.

### Operator Examples

Let's start off our examples with some simple math equations.

```Python
# Let's start by demonstrating each of the 4 basic math operations.

x = 8
y = 12

# Addition
addition = x + y
print("x + y = ", addition)

# Subtraction
subtraction = x - y
print("x - y = ", subtraction)

# Multiplication
multiplication = x * y
print("x * y = ", multiplication)

# Division; x and y are both integers, but when we do a regular division, remember that the output will be a float, even if x is divisible by y
division = x / y
print("x / y = ", division)
```

As you'd probably expect, this short program simply displays the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the numbers 8 and 12. Now let's see an example about some slightly more complicated math operations.

```Python
# Some more advanced math operations
x = 20
y = 6

# Integer division
# Integer division is different from regular division, because the result will always be an integer, even if x is not divisible by y.
# It does not round, however, it will always just cut off the decimal part, aka floor.
int_division = x // y
print("x // y = ", int_division)
# Regular division would output about 3.333, but integer division outputs 3

# Modulo
# Modulo is the remainder after division. It is always an integer, and is always positive.
modulo = x % y
print("x % y = ", modulo)

# Exponentiation
# Exponentiation is the power of. It is the same as raising x to the power of y.
exponentiation = x ** y
print("x ** y = ", exponentiation)
# This is like multiplying x by itself y times. This leads to some large numbers!
# 20 * 20 * 20 * 20 * 20 * 20
```

Python follows the order of operations when calculating larger equations. This means the computer executes certain operators before the other operators. Remember the order of operations is PEMDAS:

```
Parentheses
Exponents
Multiplication/Division
Addition/Subtraction
```

But note that multiplication and division have the same priority as each other, and addition and subtraction have the same priority too. If you want a certain operator to execute first, surround it and its values in parentheses. Then, Python will execute any exponents in the equation, followed by multiplication/division, and lastly addition/subtraction. Check out the following equations and see if you can correctly guess the result. After you have guessed, run the program to see if you were right.

```Python
equation_one = 5 * 2 - 8 / 4 + 5 ** 2
print(equation_one)

equation_two = (5 + 1) ** 2 - (8 + 2) / (4 + 1)
print(equation_two)

equation_three = (47 - (3 / 1 - 2) ** (80 - (2 * (9 + 1)))) / (5 - 3)
print(equation_three)
```

It start's to look confusing with so many paretheses, but they are really helpful for specifying what we want to do first!

Now, assignment operators. These are useful shortcuts we can use to reassign a variable. Check out some simple examples below.

```Python
# Notice how each assignment operator has an expanded form.
# Both forms do the same thing. It is up to you to decide which one you want to use.
x = 5

# Addition assignment
x += 2   # Same as x = x + 2
print(x)

# Subtraction assignment
x -= 2   # Same as x = x - 2
print(x)

# Multiplication assignment
x *= 2   # Same as x = x * 2
print(x)

# Division assignment
x /= 2   # Same as x = x / 2
print(x)

# Since division turned x into a float, set x back to an integer
x = 5

# Exponentiation assignment
x **= 2  # Same as x = x ** 2
print(x)

# Modulo assignment
x %= 9   # Same as x = x % 2
print(x)

# Integer division assignment
x //= 2  # Same as x = x // 2
print(x)
```

And now onto the comparison operators. These compare 2 values, and result in a boolean value.

```Python
# Comparison operators

x = 5
y = 8

# Equals
x_equals_y = x == y
print("x == y: ", x_equals_y)

# Not equals
x_not_equals_y = x != y
print("x != y: ", x_not_equals_y)

# Greater than
x_greater_than_y = x > y
print("x > y: ", x_greater_than_y)

# Less than
x_less_than_y = x < y
print("x < y: ", x_less_than_y)

# Greater than or equal to
x_greater_than_or_equal_to_y = x >= y
print("x >= y: ", x_greater_than_or_equal_to_y)

# Less than or equal to
x_less_than_or_equal_to_y = x <= y
print("x <= y: ", x_less_than_or_equal_to_y)
```

These comparison operators are really helpful for determining the flow of a program! We can use *if statements* along with comparisons to tell the program what to do based on certain conditions! But, let's cover *one more* group of operators first.

Logical operators are really neat, because unlike the rest of the operators we covered, these operators *only* deal with booleans. They take booleans as inputs, and output a single boolean as the result.

```Python
# The not operator
# If x is true, then not x will be false. If x is false, then not x will be true.
x = True
not_x = not x
print("not x: ", not_x)

x = False
not_x = not x
print("not x: ", not_x)

# The and operator
# x and y is true ONLY if both x and y are true.
x = True
y = True
and_x_and_y = x and y
print("x and y: ", and_x_and_y)

# If a single value is false, then the entire expression is false.
x = True
y = False
and_x_and_y = x and y
print("x and y: ", and_x_and_y)

# The or operator
# x or y is true if at least one of x or y is true.
x = True
y = True
or_x_or_y = x or y
print("x or y: ", or_x_or_y)

x = True
y = False
or_x_or_y = x or y
print("x or y: ", or_x_or_y)

x = False
y = False
or_x_or_y = x or y
print("x or y: ", or_x_or_y)
```

## Closing

Wow that was a lot to take in! When first learning about operators, it can be confusing. So don't worry if you don't understand some of it! We will become familiar with operators over time as we use them.

## Challenge

For this lesson, we won't have a challenge. Instead, begin working on Lesson 4, which goes over controlling program flow with if statements! This is when programming really begins to be fun!
