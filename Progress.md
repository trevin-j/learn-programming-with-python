# Project Progress

Note: This project is being worked on currently as a solo project by me (Trevin Jones) in my free time. I want to get this guide to a point where it genuinely is helpful for people to learn to program. This takes lot's of time, planning, and dedication to do, and sometimes I just can't output lessons quickly enough. I would gladly accept help with this project as well, especially in completing portions of the guide that are incomplete for Mac or Linux users. I haven't yet set any contribution guidelines, but reach out to me at trevindjones@gmail.com or make an issue and we can work something out. It would involve creating a fork and eventually a PR to this repo. Thanks!
