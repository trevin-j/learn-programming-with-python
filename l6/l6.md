# Lesson 6: While loops




## Loops

When we program, we often have pieces of code that need to be ran more than one time. If we wanted to print "Hello" a bunch of times, we could do this:

```python
print("Hello")
print("Hello")
print("Hello")
print("Hello")
print("Hello")
print("Hello")
```

This code works, but it is generally considered bad code because it is the same code used over and over again. Also, what if we want to keep on doing some code, but stop when the user says stop? If we just hard-code a bunch of print statements, we can't do that. This is just one of the many reasons why loops are very powerful in programming!

In general, there are two types of loops used in programming:
* For loops
* While loops

## While loops

In this lesson, we are going to focus on while loops. We won't worry about for loops until next lesson.
