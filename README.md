# Preface

## Why am I making this guide?
---
Because I care! And I'm not just saying that! When I began to learn programming on my own, I had such a difficult time learning. It was so discouraging. I had no one that I could talk to that could help me! There are so many resources online, but I just didn't know which to choose!

Existing tutorials and guides are great! But over the last few months I've started to think about how I wish I had gone about learning how to program. I have been a part of several classes designed to teach programming. They all had a lot of great teaching strategies, but I felt like something was missing.

I am creating this guide to help guide the reader towards a goal. I want to teach the logic, and not just the language. I want my readers to get that fulfilling sense of accomplishment from writing their first program on their own. I want **you** to feel the power that you have at your fingertips whenever you are writing code! I want you to finsish this course and walk away feeling confident in your newfound abilities. *I want* to ignite that spark in you that was ignited in me when I wrote my first program on my little Ti-85 calculator back in the 8th grade.

## Prerequisites
---
* None! I only expect that you have some familiarity with the file system of the operating system of your choice!


## Tools we will use
---
For any tools that we will use, we will go over how to properly install or set them up, so you don't have to worry about installing anything beforehand!

* Python - We will use Python to learn how to program! This tutorial will use Python 3.10.4, but the vast majority of new Python versions should work just fine! If there are any big differences between versions, this tutorial will be updated to cover such differences.
* Visual Studio Code - Visual Studio Code is a text editor that we will use to edit our Python code. Visual Studio Code is a fantastic open-source editor developed by Microsoft. It has tons of extension support and works extremely well with all sorts of different technologies. You are welcome to use any other text editor or IDE that you want, as long as you learn how to use them on your own!
* Some VS Code extensions - We will go over specific ones when we get to it!
* A command line - If you have a Windows 10 or 11 PC, you will likely use CMD, PowerShell, or Windows Terminal. On Mac or Linux, this will just be your terminal. We won't spend a whole lot of time here, but a command line will eventually become a valuable tool to you, should you continue down the path of programming.


## Goals
---

One of the main struggles that a lot of people have when they learn how to program isn't learning a programming language. In fact, learning a language is far easier than it sounds! The most difficult part about programming (in my own experience, as well as others I have spoken to about this) is learning the logic behind programming, and realizing how you can use what you've learned.

When I started learning programming on my own, you would not believe the amount of times that I would finish a tutorial and just think, "great! But now what?" It is fun and all to learn how to program by following a video series, and to make your own game with PyGame by following a tutorial, but once you can learn how to program using *your own* logic, you won't believe the rush you feel! I've never had a more fulfilling sense of accomplishment than the times that I finished a big section of code entirely by my self, using *my own* logic.

This isn't to say that you shouldn't watch tutorial videos! In fact, watching [TechWithTim](https://www.youtube.com/TechWithTim) create games with Python helped me to learn a lot about programming! In fact, I have listed a lot of my personal favorite resources for programming [here!](#resources)

Now, I have 3 ultimate goals that I want to accomplish with this guide.

1. I want you to learn *how to learn*. Yes. I know that is cliche. And I know me telling that it is cliche... is cliche. There is a reason it is clich! **It's important!** Being a programmer means you are always learning something new! I want you to learn how to keep learning on your own.

2. I want you to learn how to think like a programmer. This doesn't mean being an expert programmer after you finish this guide. This means learning how to think critically and deeply about each small, individual step. Every problem, no matter how big, can be solved with a large number of very small steps. Part of being a programmer is breaking down large, overwhelming problems into small steps that aren't too difficult to handle.

3. I want you to find your passion! Programming isn't for everyone, but I want this guide to be enjoyable! And remember that programming is such a **broad** field. There is plenty more to being a programmer than I am able to teach you in one guide!


## Teaching structure
---

In this guide, I will do my best to employ a consistent teaching structure, designed to **teach**, **guide**, **challenge**, and **empower** you. I believe that if you follow along with every challenge and example, and spend a little of your own time programming, you will be up and creating your own programs in no time at all. That isn't to say  that this will be easy, but I will do my best to make it worth your while. And let's have some fun  with it!

This is the teaching structure that most lessons will have:

1. Teach - In the teach section I will lay out the information in an easy to understand way, and explain it. I will include graphics, tables, charts, anything that I believe will help you to learn better.

2. Example - Each lesson will have at least one example that we  will walk through together. Remember to follow along! Writing your own code while following the example can make a huge difference with your success in this guide!

3. More teaching and example sections - Many lessons will include multiple teach and example sections.

4. Challenge - Each lesson will pose a challenge to you. Your job will be to work through it as much as you can on your own! I **highly** encourage you to work through it as far as you can! Challenging yourself is a great way to learn! Each challenge will provide one example of a solution. Some lessons may have more than one challenge.

5. Apply it - Each lesson will conclude with a way in which the topic can be applied. You are encouraged to do a lot of experimenting on your own between lessons! 

## Resources
---

These are just a few of the *many* resources that are out there to help you program. These are handpicked by myself, as they are resources I am familiar with and have grown to love.

* [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) - GeeksforGeeks is one of my all time favorite resources! They cover nearly *any* programming topic you could think of! This site is fabulous for a quick reference, or jump starting a new technology you are learning.

* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is another fantastic site to help you program. I find that it is especially helpful as a reference. They cover a wide variety of languages, all the way from HTML to C++. Check out their main page, and scroll down to the bottom to see all the many technologies they have a reference for.

* YouTube - Obviously watching videos is a great help to learning programming! Here are just a *few* of the many channels that have personally helped me a lot in my programming journey:

    * [TechWithTim](https://www.youtube.com/TechWithTim)
    * [sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/sentdex)

* Each language you learn likely has their own site dedicated as a reference, or even a tutorial. For example, Python has an official [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) and [tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)!

## About me
---
My name is Trevin Jones. At the time of writing this, I am a student studying computer science at BYU-Idaho. Programming is my passion! I am almost always learning a new technology, whether on my own or through a university course! I also love helping others learn how to program, because I want to share what I know with anyone who wants to learn! 

My passion for technology started at a fairly young age. When I was only 8 years old, I had my first encounter with an... iPod Touch! Man, I thought that was the coolest thing ever when I saw it. From the moment I played my first game of *Doodle Jump*, I wanted to know everything about how it worked. This curiosity inspired me to become who I am today.

I grew up in Montana, where technology classes don't exactly exist yet in school. Until I was a junior in high school, there wasn't a single programming class offered in my whole school! During my later years of elementary school, I found an app that taught me how to use block-coding. It was fun, but very limited. Unfortunately it didn't help me to learn anything, either.

I wrote my first program in a real language when I was in 8th grade, on a calculator that is even older than I am! I wrote a simple program that calculated the Pythagorean Theorem (that I used on my math test!) in a language called Ti-Basic. Many Texas Instruments calculators support programming this language. I remember being so proud of myself for writing it.

Over the next few years, I was unable to really learn much more about programming. I continued to learn Ti-Basic with a newer calculator that I had gotten. One day I even programmed a pong game to play during my math class when I got bored! My classmates got a kick out of that! Finally during my junior year, the high school finally offered a programming class. The class was really simple, and the teacher's main subject wasn't even programming! We learned an old language based on a really old curriculum. The language was called Blitz Basic. I would not suggest learning it today, but it helped me to grasp the absolute basics of thinking like a programmer.

My senior year, my teacher switched the curriculum to try an online curriculum. I was only able to take one semester of programming my senior year. But since we were on an online curriculum, we could go at our own pace to learn Python. I finished the entire semester's worth of work in less than a month! That course only taught me the very very basics of Python, and I plan to go more in depth with this guide than that class did. But that class inspired me to work harder to learn on my own.

From there I began to teach myself something new about programming every single week. I followed significantly more tutorials and learned a lot more than I had ever learned in that high school class!

Right about this time, Covid began to spread quite badly. My school was closed down, and classes moved to online. Against my better judgement, I ceased to work on most of my homework, and instead I doubled down on programming. But this is not something I would suggest! School is important, don't ignore it!!

Fast forward to today, I have taken numerous college courses and learned so much about programming that I never knew I could learn. The courses here helped me to see that everyone can learn on their own, but sometimes a little guidance goes a long way! I hope that my guide will help you get pointed in the right direction.
