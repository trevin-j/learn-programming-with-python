## Output
---
While we are beginning to learn Python, every program we write will be based in the command line. This means that everything we display to the user and every input we get from the user will be passed through the terminal. I know, this may seem boring, but eventually you'll see that it can still be just as fun! There is a lot more potential to the command line than you might think! For example, the command line is incredibly useful *even if* we are creating a full application!

Whenever we display information to the command line, we usually call this **printing**. Now, whenever we talk about printing, this has nothing to do with a physical printer! Instead, this means printing, or *displaying* something to the screen. In Python, this is super simple! In fact, you have already printed something to the screen before, after we set up our development environment! We did this using Python's builtin `print()` function. The print function takes in some information, called an *argument*, and displays it to the screen. We will learn more about functions and arguments at a later date, but for now you just need to know that a function is a piece of code that *does something*. Super vague, I know! But it's true!

Now let's test out the print function!

### Example
---
Alright, let's create a program to display a joke to the screen!

```Python
print("How many programmers does it take to change a lightbulb?")
print("None because that's a hardware problem!")
```

After running the code, the following should print to the screen:
```
How many programmers does it take to change a lightbulb?
None because that's a hardware problem!
```

Great! Now let's talk a little bit more about that code. First, notice how we have quotation marks in the print statements. This is because everything we type is assumed to be some sort of Python code. But we don't want Python to execute our joke as code! So we create what is called a **string**. A string is what we call a series of letters put together. A string is created by putting something between `"` or `'` marks. In some languages, the programmer is *required* to use a specific mark, but in Python, we are allowed to use whichever we want to. Throughout this guide, you will see me use double quotes most of the time. However, you may use whichever you like. What is important is to stay consistent.

Now, notice how `print` is all lowercase! Python is *case-sensitive*, meaning we can't use any capital letters in the word "print", or we will get an error!

Now that we can display information to the screen, let's talk about a more complicated but *essential* topic: variables!

## Variables

If you have experience working with variables in math, then great! You've already got a head start! But even then, variables can be somewhat difficult to grasp! So let's try to visualize this.

Imagine that we have a box. Inside this box, we will store something. Let's store a number. How about 42? We now have a box that holds the value 42 inside of it. Now, let's give this box a label so that we can keep track of it and know what the value inside means! Since according to the *Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*, the meaning of life is 42, let's call it that!

Now that we have labeled our box and put a value in it, we have already created a variable!

In Python, we can't have any spaces in the name of our variable, so let's put underscores (`_`) in between each word in the variable name. This is the common convention used for naming variables in Python, and it is called "snake_case".

```Python
meaning_of_life = 42
```

Great! But now what? Well, since the meaning_of_life is a box, that means we can change what is in the box if we want to! So if I want to change the meaning of life to be 41 instead, all I have to do is reassign it to that value! By the way, the equals sign (`=`) is called the assignment operator, because we use it to assign a value to a variable, or in other words, to put a specific value into that box.

```Python
meaning_of_life = 41
```

Variables can hold a lot more than just numbers! A variable can hold an integer number, a floating point number (a number with a decimal point), strings, a collection of data, and even more complex objects. 

Great, so now we can store stuff in variables. But now what? Well, now that we have *stored* this value, we can also *use* the value in the variable. For example, I want you to guess what the following code does:

```Python
number_of_apples = 16
number_of_oranges = number_of_apples
```

Well, let's take a look. We assign 16 to the number of apples. Then, we assign the number of apples to the number of oranges. So what does `number_of_oranges` equal? You got it, 16!

![Variable usage demo](res/img/VariableUseDemo.gif)

Now, let's combine what we have learned so far!

### Example
---

Variables can be used with print statements to display information to the user! We can assign a variable and print it out!

```Python
favorite_food = "pizza"

print("My favorite food is: ")
print(favorite_food)
```

This program stores pizza as favorite_food, and then displays that to the user.

This next program gets just a little bit more complicated. See if you can figure out what it is doing!


```Python
first_name = "Joe"
last_name = "Mama"

print("Hello,", first_name, last_name, "!")
```

Without running it, can you guess what this will print? We haven't covered passing multiple arguments to the print function yet, so if you weren't able to figure it out, that's ok! Try running it and seeing the result!

Running the print function with multiple arguments displays a message with all of the arguments put together, with spaces in between each one!

This is awesome and all, but now we are about to get into the interactivity! Let's learn about how to use user input!


## Input
---
Input is a really important aspect of software today! After all, what would be the point in a computer and software if there's no way to interact with the software? So, let's learn about user input!

Getting user input is actually super easy! Python has a builtin `input()` function to handle this for us! When we call the input function, it gives us a **string** which we can store in a variable. If we don't assign input to a variable, then we can't read what the user typed!

Here we have a simple program that let's the user type something, then it prints out what was typed. To type in your input, click on the terminal and begin typing. Press enter to enter your input.

```Python
user_input = input()
print(user_input)
```

I'm sure you noticed that we still used parentheses without even including an argument! Well, it is actually *required* to use parentheses to call a function. If you don't include them, Python will think that input is a variable, but it isn't!

The input function also takes an optional argument. If we enter a string as an argument, it will display it right next to where we input.

```Python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Name:", name)
```

Pretty neat, huh? Let's cover one more important topic, then I have a challenge for you to complete.


## Comments
---
A comment in programming is a piece of code *that is not executed*. When you run a program, Python completelly ignores every comment as if it wasn't there! But how do we add comments?

In Python, there are two ways that we can add comments to our code. The first way is to use a `#` sign. When we put this in a line of code, anything *after* the symbol gets completely ignored by Python. The other way is to surround the comment with 3 quote marks. That can mean either `'''` or `"""`. Anything in between 2 sets of 3 quote marks gets ignored.

For one moment, I want you to imagine your code as a page of homework that you have to turn in to get graded. While you are working on that homework, you decide to put sticky notes on the page to help you remember things. Well, when you turn in that assignment, you aren't going to turn it in with sticky notes all over it! You will take them off because they are only meant for you, the student! That's like how comments work in Python. You, the student, are the developer. The assignment is your code, and the sticky notes are comments. Your teacher grading your homework is Python running your code. The only difference is we don't have to get rid of our comments before running it, Python automatically ignores them.

```Python
# This is a comment and will be ignored
print("Comments don't do anything!")

"""
All this code will be ignored
print("Python ignores me!")
x = 15
print(x)
"""
print("Python doesn't ignore me!")
```

Try running the following code and find the secret message:

```Python
{% highlight python %}
# print("A")
print("c")
""" print("i") """
print("o")
print("m")
"""
print("g")
print("W")
print("2")
"""
print("m")
print("e")
print("n")
"""
# print("v")
print("&")
"""
print("t")
print("s")
print("!")
{% endhighlight%}
```

Did you see the secret message?

Ok, so if comments don't do anything then what's the point of them? Well, there are a few uses!

When we are writing code, we want to be able to remember how that code works for when we go back to look over it or make changes. This is called **documenting** your code. Documenting is a *very* important part of coding! It's easy and makes it way easier to remember how your code works! But it is frequently overlooked by many beginning programmers! I would challenge you to document your code as often as you can! Here is an example of documentation.

```Python
# This line assigns the value 15 to x.
x = 15

# This block of code gets the user's birthday then prints it to the screen.
birthday = ("Enter your birthday: ")
print("Your birthday is", birthday)
```

You should always strive to make your code easy to read and understand, and documenting it makes it that much easier to read.

Another common use is blocking out code that might have an issue. If you suspect that a specific line in your program is causing a bug, you can put a `#` in front of it and see what happens when that line doesn't execute!

A third common use is to make a note of something that needs to be done. For example, you could put `# TODO: Add username` at the end of the line to remind yourself that you need to add a username!

## Challenge
---
Now that we have covered some important Python topics, I have a challenge for you to create your very own simple program.

The goal of the program is to get the name of the user, their birthday, their favorite flavor of ice cream, their phone number, and their address. Then, print that information out in a neat format. Be sure to include comments in your code! The program should run similarly to this:

```
Please enter your name: Billy
Hello, Billy !
Please enter the following information.
--------------------------------
Birthday: 5/22/2000
Favorite ice cream flavor: mint
Phone number: 123-456-7890
Address: 123 Address Rd.
================================
Name     Birthday       Favorite Ice Cream    Phone Number   Address
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Billy   5/22/2000   mint   123-456-7890   123 Address Rd.
```

When you are done, compare your program to [this solution](solution.py), which is one of many possible solutions to this challenge!
